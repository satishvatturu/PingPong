# PingPong-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using Java Swing and Java AWT. The game has two modes - single player and multiplayer, where players can compete against each other. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball with the paddle and preventing it from falling off the screen. The game ends when one player reaches a certain number of points, or when a player misses the ball.
Requirements:
Java 8 or higher
Java Swing and Java AWT libraries
